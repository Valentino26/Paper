  abstract = {The extreme geological activity that makes Jupiter's moon Io the most volcanically active body in the Solar System is thought to be the result of tides raised by Jupiter, but it is not known whether the current tidal heat production is sufficiently high to generate the observed surface heat flow. Making use of astrometric observations made between 1891 and 2007, Lainey et al. have estimated the tidal dissipation in Io by tracking its effect on the orbital motions of the Galilean moons. For Io the value is in good agreement with the observed surface heat flow and suggests that Io is close to thermal equilibrium. Dissipation in Jupiter is close to the upper bound of its average value expected from the long-term evolution of the system.}

title = {The Gravitational Imprint of an Interior–Orbital Resonance in Jupiter–Io},
journal = {The Planetary Science Journal},
abstract = {At mid-mission perijove 17, NASA’s Juno mission has revealed a 7σ discrepancy between Jupiter’s observed high-degree tidal response and the theoretical equilibrium tidal response, namely, the Love number k 42. Here we propose an interpretation for this puzzling disagreement based on an interior–orbital resonance between internal gravity waves trapped in Jupiter’s dilute core and the orbital motion of Io. We use simple Jupiter models to calculate a fractional correction Δk 42 to the equilibrium tidal response that comes from the dynamical tidal response of a g–mode trapped in Jupiter’s dilute core. Our results suggest that an extended dilute core (r ≳ 0.7 R J) produces an interior–orbital resonance with Io that modifies Jupiter’s tidal response in Δk 42 ∼ −11%, allowing us to fit Juno’s k 42. In our proposed self-consistent scenario, Jupiter’s dilute core evolves in resonant locking with Io’s orbital migration, which allows the interior–orbital resonance to persist over geological timescales. This scenario requires a dilute core that becomes smoother or shrinks over time, together with a  mode (ℓ, m, n = 4, 2, 1) with resonant tidal dissipation reaching Q 4 ∼ 1000. Jupiter’s dilute core evolution path and the dissipation mechanism for the resonant  mode are uncertain and motivate future analysis. No other alternative exists so far to explain the 7σ discrepancy in Juno k 42. Our proposed interior–orbital resonance can be tested by Juno observations of k 42 tides raised on Jupiter by Europa, as obtained at the end of the extended mission (mid-2025), and by future seismological observations of Jupiter’s  mode oscillation frequency.}

    abstract = {We discuss the linear response to low-frequency tidal forcing of fluid bodies that are slowly and uniformly rotating, are neutrally stratified and may contain a solid or fluid core. This problem may be regarded as a simplified model of astrophysical tides in convective regions of stars and giant planets. The response can be separated into non-wavelike and wavelike parts, where the former is related instantaneously to the tidal potential and the latter may involve resonances or other singularities. The imaginary part of the potential Love number of the body, which is directly related to the rates of energy and angular momentum exchange in the tidal interaction and to the rate of dissipation of energy, may have a complicated dependence on the tidal frequency. However, a certain frequency average of this quantity is independent of the dissipative properties of the fluid and can be determined by means of an impulse calculation. The result is a strongly increasing function of the size of the core when the tidal potential is a sectoral harmonic, especially when the body is not strongly centrally condensed. However, the same is not true for tesseral harmonics, which receive a richer response and may therefore be important in determining tidal evolution even though they are usually subdominant in the expansion of the tidal potential. We also discuss analytically the low-frequency response of a slowly rotating homogeneous fluid body to tidal potentials proportional to spherical harmonics of degrees less than five. Tesseral harmonics of degrees greater than two, such as are present in the case of a spin–orbit misalignment, can resonate with inertial modes of the full sphere, leading to an enhanced tidal interaction.},

We present a simple calculation of the dynamical Love number of Jupiter that explains the observed “anomaly.” The Love number is usually dominated by the response of the (rotation-modified) f-modes of the planet. Our method also allows for efficient computation of high-order dynamical Love numbers. While the inertial-mode contributions to the Love numbers are negligible, a sufficiently strong stratification in a large region of the planet’s interior would induce significant g-mode responses and influence the measured Love numbers.}

abstract = {The Juno spacecraft measured Jupiter’s gravity field and determined the even and odd zonal harmonics, J  n , with unprecedented precision. However, interpreting these observations has been a challenge because it is difficult to reconcile the unexpectedly small magnitudes of the moments J 4 and J 6 with conventional interior models that assume a large, distinct core of rock and ice. Here we show that the entire set of gravity harmonics can be matched with models that assume an ab initio equation of state, wind profiles, and a dilute core of heavy elements that are distributed as far out as 63% of the planet’s radius. In the core region, heavy elements are predicted to be distributed uniformly and make up only 18% by mass because of dilution with hydrogen and helium. Our models are consistent with the existence of primary and secondary dynamo layers that will help explain the complexity of the observed magnetic field.}

    abstract = {We study the fate of internal gravity waves approaching the centre of an initially non-rotating solar-type star, by performing three-dimensional numerical simulations using a Boussinesq-type model. These waves are excited at the top of the radiation zone by the tidal forcing of a short-period planet on a circular, coplanar orbit. This extends previous work done in two dimensions by Barker \&amp; Ogilvie. We first derive a linear wave solution, which is not exact in three dimensions; however, the reflection of ingoing waves from the centre is close to perfect for moderate amplitude waves. Waves with sufficient amplitude to cause isentropic overturning break, and deposit their angular momentum near the centre. This forms a critical layer, at which the angular velocity of the flow matches the orbital angular frequency of the planet. This efficiently absorbs ingoing waves, and spins up the star from the inside out, while the planet spirals into the star.We also perform numerical integrations to determine the linearized adiabatic tidal response throughout the star, in a wide range of solar-type stellar models with masses in the range 0.5 ≤m★/M⊙≤ 1.1, throughout their main-sequence lifetimes. The aim is to study the influence of the launching region for these waves at the top of the radiation zone in more detail, and to determine the accuracy of a semi-analytic approximation for the tidal torque on the star, which was derived under the assumption that all ingoing wave angular momentum is absorbed in a critical layer.The main conclusion of this work is that this non-linear mechanism of tidal dissipation could provide an explanation for the survival of all short-period extrasolar planets observed around FGK stars, while it predicts the destruction of more massive planets. This work provides further support for the model outlined in a previous paper by Barker \&amp; Ogilvie, and makes predictions that will be tested by ongoing observational studies, such as WASP and Kepler.},

title = {NONLINEAR TIDES IN CLOSE BINARY SYSTEMS},
journal = {The Astrophysical Journal},
abstract = {We study the excitation and damping of tides in close binary systems, accounting for the leading-order nonlinear corrections to linear tidal theory. These nonlinear corrections include two distinct physical effects: three-mode nonlinear interactions, i.e., the redistribution of energy among stellar modes of oscillation, and nonlinear excitation of stellar normal modes by the time-varying gravitational potential of the companion. This paper, the first in a series, presents the formalism for studying nonlinear tides and studies the nonlinear stability of the linear tidal flow. Although the formalism we present is applicable to binaries containing stars, planets, and/or compact objects, we focus on non-rotating solar-type stars with stellar or planetary companions. Our primary results include the following: (1) The linear tidal solution almost universally used in studies of binary evolution is unstable over much of the parameter space in which it is employed. More specifically, resonantly excited internal gravity waves in solar-type stars are nonlinearly unstable to parametric resonance for companion masses M′ ≳ 10–100 M⊕ at orbital periods P ≈ 1–10 days. The nearly static “equilibrium” tidal distortion is, however, stable to parametric resonance except for solar binaries with P ≲ 2–5 days. (2) For companion masses larger than a few Jupiter masses, the dynamical tide causes short length scale waves to grow so rapidly that they must be treated as traveling waves, rather than standing waves. (3) We show that the global three-wave treatment of parametric instability typically used in the astrophysics literature does not yield the fastest-growing daughter modes or instability threshold in many cases. We find a form of parametric instability in which a single parent wave excites a very large number of daughter waves (N ≈ 103[P/10 days] for a solar-type star) and drives them as a single coherent unit with growth rates that are a factor of ≈N faster than the standard three-wave parametric instability. These are local instabilities viewed through the lens of global analysis; the coherent global growth rate follows local rates in the regions where the shear is strongest. In solar-type stars, the dynamical tide is unstable to this collective version of the parametric instability for even sub-Jupiter companion masses with P ≲ a month. (4) Independent of the parametric instability, the dynamical and equilibrium tides excite a wide range of stellar p-modes and g-modes by nonlinear inhomogeneous forcing; this coupling appears particularly efficient at draining energy out of the dynamical tide and may be more important than either wave breaking or parametric resonance at determining the nonlinear dissipation of the dynamical tide.}

title = {Dynamical Tidal Love Numbers of Rapidly Rotating Planets and Stars},
journal = {The Astrophysical Journal},
abstract = {Tidal interactions play an important role in many astrophysical systems, but uncertainties regarding the tides of rapidly rotating, centrifugally distorted stars and gaseous planets remain. We have developed a precise method for computing the dynamical, nondissipative tidal response of rotating planets and stars, based on summation over contributions from normal modes driven by the tidal potential. We calculate the normal modes of isentropic polytropes rotating at up to ≃90% of their critical breakup rotation rates, and tabulate fits to mode frequencies and tidal overlap coefficients that can be used to compute the frequency-dependent, nondissipative tidal response (via potential Love numbers k  ℓm ). Although fundamental modes (f-modes) possess dominant tidal overlap coefficients at (nearly) all rotation rates, we find that the strong coupling of retrograde inertial modes (i-modes) to tesseral (ℓ &gt; ∣m∣) components of the tidal potential produces resonances that may be relevant to gas giants like Jupiter and Saturn. The coupling of f-modes in rapid rotators to multiple components of both the driving tidal potential and the induced gravitational field also affect the tesseral response, leading to significant deviations from treatments of rotation that neglect centrifugal distortion and high-order corrections. For very rapid rotation rates (≳70% of breakup), mixing between prograde f-modes and i-modes significantly enhances the sectoral (ℓ = ∣m∣) tidal overlap of the latter. The tidal response of very rapidly rotating, centrifugally distorted planets or stars can also be modified by resonant sectoral f-modes that are secularly unstable via the Chandrasekhar–Friedman–Schutz mechanism.}
