# Review Paper of Dynamical Tides in Jupiter and the Role of Interior Structure (Yufeng Lin)
Review Paper created in the VU Academic Writing and Presenting of the BSc Astronomy at the University of Vienna.

## Abstract 
**Context** Gaseous planets like Jupiter’s orbital development, angular momentum exchange, and interior structure
depend on tidal interactions. Dynamic tides use inertial and gravity waves to dissipate energy, while equilibrium tides
represent large-scale hydrostatic deformation owing to tidal forcing. Recent observations of Jupiter’s tidal Love numbers
suggest that classic equilibrium tide models may not be sufficient, requiring a more detailed dynamical approach.
**Aims** This study examines Jupiter’s dynamical tides, how different internal theories affect them, and whether Love
number discrepancies are due to a dilute core, stratification, or rotational effects. By using a broader paradigm, we
hope to understand how interior structure affects tidal dissipation.
**Methods** We use a completely compressible, self-gravitating fluid model that includes Coriolis force and dynamical
tidalresponse.ThenumericalmethodusessphericalharmonicsforangulardecompositionandChebyshevcollocationfor

dilute core, and stratified outer layer interior models.
**Results** We found that dynamical tides considerably alter Jupiter’s tidal response, bringing model predictions closer
to Love numbers. Dynamic tides effectively resolve the disparity in $\Delta k_{22}$, but not in $\Delta k_{42}, indicating the need for
further modifications in stratification, rotation, or viscosity effects. This work emphasizes the role of dynamical tides
in planetary models and constrains Jupiter’s internal structure based on its tidal response.
